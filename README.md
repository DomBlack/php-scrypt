PHP scrypt module
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DomBlack/php-scrypt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DomBlack/php-scrypt)

This is a PHP library providing a wrapper to [Colin Percival's scrypt implementation](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html). Scrypt is a key derivation function designed to be far more secure against hardware brute-force attacks than alternative functions such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt.

Details of the scrypt key derivation function are given in a paper by Colin Percival, Stronger Key Derivation via Sequential Memory-Hard Functions: [PDF](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt-slides.pdf).

An example class using this module can be found in; scrypt.php

PECL Install
============

This extension is now avaible through PECL.

```
pecl install scrypt
```

Build From Source
=================

Unix/OSX
--------

1. `phpize`
2. If on OSX; `export CFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64'`
3. `./configure --enable-scrypt`
4. `make`
5. `make install`
6. Add the extension to your php.ini

````
    ; Enable scrypt extension module
    extension=scrypt.so
````

Windows
-------

Using Visual Studio 2008 (or Visual C++ Express 2008) open up the attached project
inside the VS2008 folder. This project assumes you have the PHP thread safe source at;
`C:\phpsrcts\`, a PHP install at `C:\php\` and this source code extracted to
`C:\php-scrypt\`.

1. Build the project.
2. Copy the resultant `scrypt.dll` to your ext directory in PHP.
3. Add the extension to your php.ini

````
    ; Enable scrypt extension module
    extension=scrypt.dll
````
Code demo
=================
```php
<?php
        $passwd = "123456";
        $salt = "1d39076d7f7ec3eacc8847ec3a87ce4f3a9fb651a92f5df40cb6ac5252b29972";
        $N = 262144;
        $r = 8;
        $p = 1;
        $dkLen = 32;
        $out = scrypt($passwd, hex2bin($salt), $N, $r, $p, $dkLen);
        echo $out;
?>
```
